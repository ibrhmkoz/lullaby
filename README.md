# lullaby

`lullaby` is a Go package that helps you gracefully manage service lifecycles. Built on top of [sourcegraph/conc](https://github.com/sourcegraph/conc), it embraces structured concurrency patterns to coordinate the starting and stopping of multiple services while handling system signals automatically.

## Features

- üöÄ Simple API for service lifecycle management
- üîÑ Coordinated service startup and shutdown
- ‚ö° Concurrent service stopping with structured concurrency (via `sourcegraph/conc`)
- ‚è∞ Configurable timeout for stopping services
- üõë Automatic stopping of all services if any fails during initialization
- üì° Built-in system signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- üîí Thread-safe stopping mechanism

## Why lullaby?

### Built on Structured Concurrency

`lullaby` is built on top of `sourcegraph/conc`, which brings structured concurrency patterns to Go. This means:
- Better goroutine lifecycle management
- Automatic panic handling
- Cleaner, more maintainable concurrent code
- Built-in error propagation

### Fail-Fast with Grace

If any service fails during initialization, `lullaby` automatically initiates a graceful stop of all other services that started successfully. This ensures your system fails predictably and cleanly:

```go
group := lullaby.New(5 * time.Second)
group.Add(service1)
group.Add(service2) // If service2 fails to start
group.Add(service3)

group.Start() // service1 will be stopped gracefully
```

### Flexible Stopping Mechanisms

While `lullaby` handles SIGINT/SIGTERM automatically, it also exposes a `Stop()` method for programmatic control. This is useful for:
- Testing scenarios
- Custom shutdown triggers (e.g., health checks, remote commands)
- Business logic-driven shutdowns

```go
// Signal-based stopping (automatic)
group.Start()

// Programmatic stopping
group.Start()
if someCondition {
    group.Stop() // Manually trigger stop
}
```

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/lullaby
```

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "time"
    "github.com/ibrhmkoz/lullaby"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new group with 5 second timeout for stopping
    group := lullaby.New(5 * time.Second)

    // Add your services
    group.Add(myService1)
    group.Add(myService2)

    // Start all services
    group.Start()
}
```

## Service Interface

Your services need to implement the `lullaby.Service` interface:

```go
type Startable interface {
    Start(context.Context) error
}

type Stoppable interface {
    Stop(context.Context) error
}

type Service interface {
    Startable
    Stoppable
}
```
